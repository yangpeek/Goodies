To ensure that each class has it's own static variable, you should use the "Curiously recurring template pattern" (CRTP).

template <typename T>
class Base
{
    static int staticVar;
};

template <typename T> int Base<T>::staticVar(0);

class DerivedA : public Base<DerivedA> {};
class DerivedB : public Base<DerivedB> {};
